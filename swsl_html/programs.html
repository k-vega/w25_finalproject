                    <p>At our Upper Elementary STEM Enrichment Program we believe that
                        learning science should be an exciting and hands-on adventure. Our
                        program is designed to inspire curiosity and spark creativity through
                        interactive activities that encourage critical thinking and problem-
                        solving. We help students build important skills, like teamwork, by working
                        together to solve challenges and explore the wonders of Science. By
                        incorporating math and all elements of STEM in fun, engaging ways, we
                        create an environment where kids don’t just learn—they discover,
                        imagine, and grow, all while having a blast!</p>

                    <p>Our near peer mentorship program connects middle school mentors and their elementary school peers helping them 
                        build leadership and communication skills. They collaborate by working on hands-on activities, problem solving 
                        challenges, and fun projects that will encourage their growth and love in STEM.
                        We believe spending time out of school to refine our skills is an integral part of STEM learning. 
                        Our after school program, STEM Unidos, hosts students grades 3-5. 
                        We delve deep into our STEM Enrichment lessons, 
                        offering more hands-on projects that help them understand the world around them. </p>
